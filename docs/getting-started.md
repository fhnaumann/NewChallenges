# Getting Started

### 1) Download the plugin

Download the plugin from [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/wand555/Challenges) and start your server. Ensure that
the plugin is enabled by entering `/plugins`. You should also see a generated `plugins/Challenges/` folder.

### 2) Create your challenge

Head over to the [challenges builder](https://www.mc-challenges.com/) and configure your challenge. You can use the
search bar at the top to search for anything by keyword. Once you have your challenge built, click on "Modify Metadata"
at the bottom of the page and **give your challenge an individual name**. This name will be used on the server 
to identify the challenge. Optionally you can set yourself as the author. 

Alternatively, you can navigate to the individual rules, goals, or settings pages here and download a sample challenge
configuration.

### 3) Export your challenge

Click on "Download Settings File". Click on "Download" to download your challenge configuration. **Put the file in the
`plugins/Challenges/settings/` folder**. Create the folder if it does not exist.

### 4) Verify your challenge

The plugin has to verify that the provided challenge ist valid. You can type `/challenges list` to get a list of all
challenges on the server. Enter `/load <challenge-name>` to verify and load your challenge.

### 5) Play your challenge

Enter `/start` to start your challenge. Have fun!
