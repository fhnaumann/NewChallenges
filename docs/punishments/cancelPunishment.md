# Cancel Punishment

Prevents the player from gaining anything by violating a rule. Anything that is gained when triggering a punishment is
removed. Disable this rule if you want players to trade the benefit of gaining what should normally be prohibited
by the rule against receiving a punishment.

!!!info Example
If NoBlockBreakRule is enabled **without** this punishment, then players can break blocks and receive them normally. They
just receive their punishments (if any are configured). If NoBlockBreakRule is enabled **with** this punishment, then
breaking blocks is completely prohibited and the block won't be broken. Additionally, the players are punished.
