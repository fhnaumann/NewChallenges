# Rules

Rules are constraints that can be added to challenges. They make reaching the [set goals](../goals/goals.md) harder by limiting different abilities in game. For example, the [NoDeathRule](noDeathRule) adds the constraint that no player may die during the challenge. Some rules have additional configuration options. The next pages will go over each rule and its configuration options. 

# Common Configuration

Every rule can be triggered when a player violates the rule. In this case some [punishments](../punishments/punishments.md) may occur, if defined. You find more information about the punishment setup in the [punishment section](../punishments/punishments.md).
